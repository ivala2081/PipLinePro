üîß MANUAL CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS

Since automated upload may have issues, here are the manual steps:

1. DOWNLOAD PUTTY/WINSCP:
   - PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/
   - WinSCP: https://winscp.net/

2. UPLOAD CLEANUP SCRIPT:
   - Use WinSCP to connect to 185.217.125.139
   - Username: root, Password: 0nJrtc9N2C  
   - Upload: deployment/complete_server_cleanup.sh
   - Upload to: /tmp/complete_server_cleanup.sh

3. CONNECT VIA PUTTY:
   - Host: 185.217.125.139
   - Username: root, Password: 0nJrtc9N2C

4. RUN CLEANUP SCRIPT:
   chmod +x /tmp/complete_server_cleanup.sh
   /tmp/complete_server_cleanup.sh

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will completely wipe the server!
‚úÖ After cleanup, the server will be ready for fresh deployment.

ALTERNATIVE: Copy and paste these commands directly in PuTTY:

# Quick server reset commands:
systemctl stop piplinepro nginx apache2 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf /opt/*
userdel -r pipline 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/piplinepro.service
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/piplinepro
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-available/piplinepro
systemctl daemon-reload
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt autoremove -y && apt autoclean

echo "‚úÖ Quick cleanup completed - ready for deployment!"

‚úÖ Cleanup script uploaded successfully!

NEXT STEPS:
1. Connect to your server via SSH:
   ssh root@185.217.125.139
   
2. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x /tmp/complete_server_cleanup.sh
   
3. Run the cleanup script:
   /tmp/complete_server_cleanup.sh
   
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: The script will ask for confirmation before destroying everything!

After cleanup is complete, you can deploy PipLinePro on the clean server.
